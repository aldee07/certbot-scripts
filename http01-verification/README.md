# CERTBOT HTTP 01 Verification Script

## Overview

This project provides a streamlined method for generating certificates with Certbot using HTTP-01 verification on an NGINX web server running on a Linux machine. This approach is especially useful for scenarios where you have access to a server but lack direct access to the DNS provider.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Creation:** Generates an acme-challenge directory in your webroot (typically located at `/var/www/`).

- **NGINX Configuration:** Automatically creates the necessary NGINX server configuration for the acme-challenge.

- **Certificate Generation:** Produces the required SSL/TLS certificates individually for each domains/subdomains defined.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A running NGINX web server.

- An active and valid domain name pointing to your server.

- Certbot version `2.*` installed.

- An empty `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory. (This is optional; if there is a working configuration, you may skip this step, but itâ€™s recommended to clean it up)

- Your current user must have sudo privileges.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**

```bash
# Replace "a.foo.com b.foo.com c.foo.com" with the appropriate subdomain.
# Replace "email@example.com" with the appropriate email that will own the certificates.
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aldee07/certbot-scripts/refs/heads/main/http01-verification/acme-generate | sudo bash -s -- -d "a.foo.com b.foo.com c.foo.com" -e "email@example.com"
```

2. **Voila!** Your certificates will be generated in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/` directory.

## Next steps

- **Use Certificates:** You may add the following to your webserver configuration:

```conf
# SSL configuration
ssl_session_timeout 1d;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:50m;

ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/<certname>/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/<certname>/privkey.pem;
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
if ($scheme = http){
  return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

```

- **Restore Previous Configurations:** If you cleaned up the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` folder earlier, you may want to restore any previous configurations and consider deleting the `acme-challenge` configuration.
